    <p>The Creativity Hub was a school project that created to promote different learning styles. This for example means things like using the arts, cultural and indigenous practices to better your learning.

  <div class="tab-pane fade" id="Keep Touch">
    <p>This is a messaging app I created, called Keep Touch. It's an online messaging system for people who are not technologically inclined.

I thought to create this app for people who are older. I found that with the people I know above 50, they had a lot of trouble understanding the concepts and functions of most applications such as WhatsApp, Messenger, Kik etc. 

Keep Touch is a good alternative as it is minimalist, light-coloured and designed to be an easy, intuitive  application with a calming affect.
