I found that with the people I know above 50, they had a lot of trouble understanding the concepts and functions of most applications such as WhatsApp, Messenger, Kik etc.  Keep Touch is a good alternative as it is minimalist, light-coloured and designed to be an easy, intuitive  application with a calming affect.</p>
