<h1>Keep Touch</h1>

<p>his is a messaging app I created, called Keep Touch. It's an online messaging system for people who are not technologically inclined.</p>
<p class="ex1">I thought to create this app for people who are older. I found that with the people I know above 50, they had a lot of trouble understanding the concepts and functions of most applications such as WhatsApp, Messenger, Kik etc. </p>
<p> Keep Touch is a good alternative as it is minimalist, light-coloured and designed to be an easy, intuitive  application with a calming affect.</p>
