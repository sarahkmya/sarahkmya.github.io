    <h4 class="card-title">Keep Touch - Oct '19</h4>
    <p class="card-text">This is a messaging app I created, called Keep Touch. It's an online messaging system for people who are not technologically inclined.I thought to create this app for people who are older. I found that with the people I know above 50, they had a lot of trouble understanding the concepts and functions of most applications such as WhatsApp, Messenger, Kik etc.  Keep Touch is a good alternative as it is minimalist, light-coloured and designed to be an easy, intuitive  application with a calming affect.</p>
