This is a messaging app I created, called Keep Touch. It's an online messaging system for people who are not technologically inclined.I thought to create this app for people who are older. I found that with the people I know above 50, they had a lot of trouble understanding the concepts and functions of most applications such as WhatsApp, Messenger, Kik etc. Keep Touch is a good alternative as it is minimalist, light-coloured and designed to be an easy, intuitive application with a calming affect.
